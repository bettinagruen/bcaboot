Bootstrap confidence intervals depend on three elements:

- the cdf of the \eqn{B} bootstrap replications \eqn{t_i^*}, \eqn{i=1\ldots B}
- the bias-correction number \eqn{z_0=\Phi(\sum_i^B I(t_i^* < t_0) / B )}
  where \eqn{t_0=f(x)} is the original estimate
- the acceleration number \eqn{a} that measures the rate of
  change in \eqn{\sigma_{t_0}} as \eqn{x}, the data changes.

The first two of these depend only on the bootstrap distribution, and
not how it is generated: parametrically or
non-parametrically. Therefore, the only difference in a parametric bca
analysis would lie in the nonparametric estimation of the
acceleration, often a negligible error.

Further details may be found in the paper by Efron and Narasimhan below.
